# CN-AlarmClock-Rishu
Hi, 
I have created this alarm clock project during my cn's full stack course. This project is a simple web-based alarm clock application built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Below are the features and functionalities of this project:
Features:

Clock Display: The application displays a digital clock showing the current time in the 12hr format.

Set Alarm: Users can set an alarm by entering the desired hours, minutes, and seconds in the respective input fields. They can also select between "AM" and "PM".

Validation: This alram clock includes validation checks on the user inputs to ensure they are in the correct FORMAT and within the VALID RANGE. If any of the input fields are empty or if the time values exceed the appropriate limits, the user is alerted with an error message.

Alarms List: The application maintains a list of set alarms below the clock display. Each entry in the list shows the alarm time along with a delete button.

Delete Alarm: Users can remove a specific alarm from the list by clicking on the delete button associated with that alarm entry.

Alarm Functionality: When the set alarm time is in the future, the application schedules an alert to notify the user at the specified alarm time. When the alarm triggers, a pop-up alert displays the message "Time to wake up!".
